```
Encode provided(python): <br>
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```

But the core logic/algorithm is:
```
prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur
```
Basically, lookup1 is the source and lookup2 consists of the target to which it'll get transformed to. <br>
cur = the current index position and prev is the previous. <br> So in output the source is being transformed to lookup2(particular index) that particular index is (current-previous mod 40).
Hence to decode this, we have to basically go bakwards. <br>
Define the lookup1 and lookup2 data. <br>
and then modify the algorithm: <br>
```
for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)  
    original_index = (cur + prev) % 40  # Reverse of (cur - prev) % 40
    out += lookup1[original_index]  
    prev = original_index  
```
The output:
<br>
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
Now this code is only going to print the characters from the string which are in positions of perfect cubes (eg - 1,8,27,64.....) <br>
So after inputting the ciphertext in the chars variable, I tried running it but it was not showing any result. There was some error. <br>
Later made to understand that this code was not Python but Python2 so I ran it on a Python2 compiler. <br>
I got this as the result
```
L
g
H
D
P
t
```
but picoCTF(LgHDPt) was not the flag.
Since the code said ``` #pythontwo and #selfinput```
I tried inputting the code to itself.
I got 
```
r
e
;
,
e
```
But that was not the answer either.
<br> I was just doing it wrong, when I correctly input the code to the code itself I got the following:
```
a
d
l
i
b
s
```
And so was the answer, picoCTF{adlibs}.





It was more of rev engg than crypto ;-;
