***Appraoching the challenge:*** <br>
The given JAVA code had a print statement at the end with a password 
(jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41) but it was not the flag. <br>
After reading the code, I could conclude that the flag shall be of 32 characters length (same as the given string's length).
and the String which was alread given (jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41) had to be rearranged according to the 4 *for* loops for the final password which shall *open* the vault and is also the flag. 
After solving the for loops, the password I got is
```
jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_c79a21
```
